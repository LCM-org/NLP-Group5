# NLP Hate Speech Detection Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the NLP Hate Speech Detection project! This project aims to develop a natural language processing (NLP) solution to identify and categorize hate speech in text data. Hate speech detection is crucial for creating a safer and more inclusive online environment.

### Project Goals

- Implement a robust NLP model for hate speech detection.
- Evaluate and fine-tune the model for optimal performance.
- Provide an open-source solution for others to use and contribute to.
